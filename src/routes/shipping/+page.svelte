<!-- here is the break down of the shipping process -->
<!-- You purchase a label from our store and package and ship the mixer to us!
We offer discounted Shipping labels, click the “label” tab in our store!
Once the label is purchased we will email it to you.  This may take a day or two.  
Please include your contact information with the mixer (writing it down on a piece of paper is fine!)
Upon finding failed/damaged parts, they will be replaced and itemized on the invoice.
If we feel the costs will be exorbitant, we will reach out for confirmation.
Once the mixer is finished and ready to ship back, you will be invoiced to the email you provided via the customer form.
$125 for a general re-grease, inspection, deep clean, and tune-up (return shipping is included in this price)
$150 for most repairs and part replacement (return shipping is included in this price). Price increases roughly $25 per part replaced!
There are circumstances in which machines can have multiple damaged parts, which could cause some price fluctuation
An invoice will be sent through QuickBooks to your email.
You can pay using a credit/debit card, bank transfer, Apple Pay, or PayPal
As soon as the invoice is paid the mixer will be shipped back to you -->
